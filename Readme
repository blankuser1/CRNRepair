This repository is for the submission to GI @ICSE '21

It contains the data for the two subjects in the study and the resulting repairs. 
The sbml files are the output of the repair and the text files are the human readable version as well as the logged changes to the orignal CRN.
We include files for both for the simulated annealing (SA) and random (Rnd) trails.
